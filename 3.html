<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가? </h2>

<img src="java.jpg" width="450">
<p>JavaScript , often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br></p>

<p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br>
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br>
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br> 
In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br>
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.<br>
The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br>
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
