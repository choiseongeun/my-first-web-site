<h2>CSS이란 무엇인가? </h2>

<img src="css.jpg" width="450">
<p></p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
SS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
This separation can improve content accessibility;<br>
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br>
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;<br>
and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br>
CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br>
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br>
This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br>
The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.<br>
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
